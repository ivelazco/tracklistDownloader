# üéµ Tracklist MP3 Downloader

This community-driven project allows you to download music from various sources as MP3 files. It supports both 1001tracklists.com tracklists and Spotify playlists. The tool works by searching YouTube for the first relevant result for every track and extracting the MP3 audio automatically.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Support for multiple sources:
  - 1001tracklists.com tracklists
  - Spotify playlists (requires Spotify API credentials)
- Automatically searches YouTube for each track
- Downloads the audio in MP3 format using `ffmpeg`
- Skips `ID-ID` and duplicate tracks
- Organizes downloads in source-specific folders

## üì¶ Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [FFmpeg](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-FFmpeg)
- A valid [YouTube API Key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)
- Spotify API credentials (only if using Spotify playlist feature)

## üöÄ Installation
We strongly recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the package manager:

```bash
yarn install
```

Alternatively:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration Setup

1. Create a `config/local.json` file by copying `config/local.json.example`:
   ```bash
   cp config/local.json.example config/local.json
   ```

2. Configure your credentials:
   - For YouTube: Get your API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - For Spotify (if needed):
     1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
     2. Log in and create a new application
     3. Get your Client ID and Client Secret
     4. Add them to your config file

3. Make sure to add `config/local.json` to your `.gitignore` to keep your credentials secure.

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "youtubeMp3Downloader": {
    "ffmpegPath": "ffmpeg",
    "outputPath": "/Users/user/Music/youtube-downloader",
    "youtubeVideoQuality": "highest",
    "queueParallelism": 10,
    "progressTimeout": 2000
  },
  "youtubeVideoSearcher": {
    "apiKey": "YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY"
  },
  "spotify": {
    "clientId": "your_spotify_client_id_here",
    "clientSecret": "your_spotify_client_secret_here"
  }
}
```
